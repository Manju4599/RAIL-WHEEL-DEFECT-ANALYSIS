# RAIL-WHEEL-DEFECT-ANALYSIS
This project implements a machine learning-based inspection system for train wheels that assists human examiners by automatically detecting defects and anomalies. The system analyzes wheel images from three different angles (outer, runway, and inside track) to identify potential issues that might require maintenance.
